name: Dragon (Excavator) Quickstart by Craghack
description: Use all gems on dragons. Probably best to rezone to 40% Stone Walls, mostly from gem mines. To get most DP might be best training all draftees into farmers and with 6 ticks left dumping all gold into Mercenaries. Left some experience points which could go more towards Drills or maybe into Fortifications.
