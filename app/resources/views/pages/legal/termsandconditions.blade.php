            <li>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</li>
            <li>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. If you have any reason to believe your password is not safe, you are required to immediately change it.</li>
            <li>Your username must not be offensive or misleading. This includes profanity, slurs, and names which may cause confusion.</li>
            <li>Accounts are personal and must not be shared. One person per account: only one person is permitted to make use of an account.</li>
            <li>If your account is suspended or banned, you are not permitted to open a new account or use another account.</li>

        <li>Game Rules
          <ol class="tc">
            <li>You are only allowed to have one dominion per round per account.</li>
            <li>You are allowed to have multiple accounts and as such have multiple dominions per round, provided that each dominion is played with equal and reasonable care and effort and that they are all in the same realm. This means they must be of the same alignment. If one is independent and randomly placed in a hostile realm, you must immediately notify us and instruct us to move the dominion to the correct realm.</li>
            <li>Your dominion name or ruler name must not be offensive, abusive, damaging, or misleading.</li>
            <li>Your dominion name must be unique and not similar enough to another dominion so as to cause confusion. If two names are found to be too similar, the latter one may be changed to a new name provided by the player or to one decided by the administrator.</li>
            <li>You must not use any tools, software, application, scripts, or otherwise to take any automatic, scripted, preprogrammed, or similarly automated actions in the game.</li>
            <li>You must not in any way cooperate with another realm or dominions in other realms, such as Non-Aggression Pacts (“NAP”), alliances, or sharing game information.</li>
            <li>You must not in any way intentionally take any action which directly or indirectly benefits another realm or a dominion in another realm.</li>
            <li>You must at all times refrain from using excessive profanity or abusive, offensive language. Banter and smack talk are allowed; just keep it mostly civil.</li>
            <li>You must not exploit any bugs in the game. A bug is a feature, mechanic, logic, or other part of the game which is not working as intended or not working at all. You are expected to have a reasonable understanding of how the game works and we will not accept ignorance as an excuse for exploiting a bug. If you find a bug, please report it immediately in Discord or by contacting an administrator.</li>
            <li>If you are negatively impacted by a bug and cannot be reasonably expected to have known about the bug, you may be compensated appropriately, at our sole discretion.</li>
            <li>If you have been negatively impacted by other players breaching the rules and this can be substantiated during the investigation, you may receive an adequate and proportionate compensation, at our sole discretion.</li>
